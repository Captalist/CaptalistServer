# Important Information
- To follow along with the development of the Captalist Server and game, check out the video logs on my youtube channel: <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDwvtvMiA-0_wbq37Sahp0ajwelzsyLX3">Playlist Link</a>
- Captalist is no longer a main project, but rather it is now a side project and will now be given "side project" time, meaning its development speed will be ultimately slowed down to later notice.
- To help out with the development of Captalist feel free to send me a email first at "codingwithcn@gmail.com", before forking the project.
