                <h1>How to play</h1>
                <p>They are different ways to play Capitalist, it all depends on the class of your chosen. Aside from the different options you have. Your main mission will be to stay alive. This is because in Capitalist &#x27;s they are many things that kill you. From hunger to dehydration and even bad government, and when ever you die your account will be deleted and you will be forced to create a new account. The main point of the deletion of account is due to the fact that we wanted the player to feel the pain of dyeing knowing they will never be able to access that account ever again. Giving a feeling of rebirth was the main goal.</p>

                <h1>How did Captalist begin</h1>
                <p>At first Capitalist &#x27;s was just a thought in the young mind of Chidozie J, Nnaji at the age of 16. He thought of a game that resembles real life. Where every decision affected the player and other players. He didn &#x27;t want any basic choice game. He wanted a game with domino effect. And on April 4th 2021, he started working on it, expecting to release the first version on 5/5/2021. </p>
